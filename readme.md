# Medical AI Assistant (MAIA) Demo

This demonstration showcases the integration of both personal and frontier AI. Chat AI queries use an extensive multidimensional (hospitals, Medicare, wearables, etc...) health record as context but there is nothing health-specific about the implementation so it should work equally well for other domains such as academic, legal, art, etc... Optionally, when used with [Trustee¬Æ Community](#software-repositories) and [NOSH](#software-repositories), MAIA is integrated in a domain-specific way to gather, organize, and share in support of a patient's journey across multiple institutions and caregivers.

**This MAIA demo can be used independently of Trustee or NOSH** when the health records context is provided directly into one or more DigitalOcean Knowledge Bases that are attached as Resources to the personal and private GenAI agent. 

When integrated with Trustee and NOSH, MAIA utilizes the [GNAP (Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol)](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Grant%20Negotiation%20and%20Authorization%20Protocol) for secure connections between components.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account to host a fork of this MAIA repository
- A DigitalOcean account for GenAI Platform, App Platform, and Cloudant database
- API keys for AI providers (DigitalOcean, Anthropic, etc.)

### üéØ Unified Setup (Recommended)

**NEW: Unified Cloudant Setup** - MAIA now uses Cloudant for both local development and production, eliminating data migration concerns.

## Overview

The purpose of this demo is to show how a personal AI with reasoning features can be used to avoid sharing sensitive data when consulting the much more powerful frontier LLMs like Anthropic, Gemini, and any number of others. A typical AI chat session begins with access to a vector database for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) that can produce a patient summary along with any more specific inferences about the private records. At any point, the user can remove sensitive information from the chat transcript and provide the entire transcript to a frontier LLM of their choice. This back and forth between personal AI and frontier LLM can continue. Future versions of MAIA should support Model Context Protocol (MCP) to further enhance effectiveness and user experience. At any point, the entire chat transcript can be saved to Cloudant.

If the MAIA is launched from the Trustee / NOSH suite of records management tools, it benefits from a more integrated experience where records can be acquired directly from EHR systems and Medicare, organized to support physicians as well as patients, and can be shared under patient control. MAIA chat transcripts can be edited, digitally signed by physicians and other licensed caregivers, and become new encounter notes in the NOSH health record.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/agropper/MAIA-vue-ai-example.git
cd MAIA-vue-ai-example

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment
cp .example.env .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# Build frontend
npm run build

# Start server
node server.js
```

### DigitalOcean App Platform

üìñ **Complete Deployment Guide:** [DIGITALOCEAN-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md](DIGITALOCEAN-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Setup Cloudant database** - See [CLOUDANT-SETUP.md](CLOUDANT-SETUP.md)
3. **Configure environment variables** in DigitalOcean App Platform
4. **Deploy** - The app will automatically build and deploy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Chrome Caching:** Use hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) or clear browser cache
- **API Key Issues:** Verify DigitalOcean agent permissions and API key validity
- **Database Connection:** Check Cloudant credentials and network connectivity

### NOSH Integration

When launched from NOSH, if the MAIA app experiences a failure, you may need to delete the cookies it sets during its function. MAIA sets two values:

- In SessionStorage, the value "gnap"
- In LocalStorage, the value "noshuri"

This should help the app to relaunch properly from NOSH.
